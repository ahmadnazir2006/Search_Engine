# 🔍 Search Engine using Binary Search Tree (BST)

This project implements a simple search engine in **C++** that stores **keywords** and their associated **URLs** using a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** and **Linked Lists**.  
Each keyword acts as a node in the BST, and every node maintains a linked list of URLs where that keyword appears.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Reads data from a text file (format: `id url` followed by `keywords`).
- Stores keywords in a Binary Search Tree (alphabetically sorted).
- Each keyword node links to one or more URLs.
- Allows users to search for any keyword and returns all matching URLs.
- Demonstrates practical use of **file handling, pointers, BSTs, and linked lists** in C++.
